          <p>
            I am a 2nd-year Computer Science student at the University of
            Leicester, United Kingdom. I have knowledge in HTML/CSS, JavaScript,
            Java, Spring Boot, MySQL and Agile Scrum methodology. Since I am
            aspiring to become a professional Software Engineer, alongside my
            studies, I am also working on personal projects to showcase my
            skills and abilities. Furthermore, I am constantly building up my
            knowledge by reading books and solving programming exercises on
            Software Engineering.
